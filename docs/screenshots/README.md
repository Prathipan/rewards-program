Place screenshots in this folder with the following filenames so they render in the root README:

- app-header-and-rules.png
- monthly-rewards.png
- transactions-table.png
- total-rewards.png
- error-state.png

Note: The app error-state screenshot can be captured by temporarily renaming public/transactions.json and refreshing the app.
